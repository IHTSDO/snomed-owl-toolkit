#
# This script is for use by the SNOMED International team to convert extension releases to Complete OWL for managed service members.
# The script provides an automated repeatable process to support testing and production upgrade of extensions to SNOMED International 20190731 edition.
# The inputs are the previous release zip, the SNOMED International complete OWL 20190731 release zip file, and the current release delta zip(optional) containing stated relationships and some OWL axioms.
# The output is a delta zip with filename starting complete-owl-axiom-delta containing the conversion results.
#  1. Inactive stated relationships for those being converted into axioms
#  2. Active OWL axiom reference sets (OWL axioms generated from active stated relationships plus any newly authoring axioms in the current authoring cycle)
#
#Note: This script is used to convert stated relationships with extension module source concepts only.
# Any concepts donated to the International Edition will be excluded as the axiom reference sets for these exist in the International complete OWL release already.
# Any extension stated relationships overriding International concepts (i.e stated relationships having International concepts as source) will not be converted into axioms by this script.
# Please check sct2_StatedRelationships_Not_Converted.txt file for the full list of stated relationships. These should be converted manually using additional axioms or GCIs.
#
#

# Make script stop if any line fails
